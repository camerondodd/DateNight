If the user decides to stay in they are navigated to a page where they will be able to look up interesting recipes using a searh term, which yields titles and pictures with links to the page where the recipe can be found, or generate an idea for something to do on the date while staying home, which includes an idea and a picture with a clickable link to relevant information.  They may click this link any number of times.
