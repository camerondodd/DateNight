# DateNight!

## Summary </br>
This is a straight forward application intended to make planning a date night easier.  The user starts on an opening page where they will decide whether they want to go out on their date, or stay in.

If the user decides to go out they are navigated to a page where they will enter their city, then be able to look up local restaurants, with links to websites, user rating, price ranges, and addresses, or events, with links to the event, start times, links to the venue, and addresses, happening that day by entering search terms.

If the user decides to stay in they are navigated to a page where they will be able to look up interesting recipes using a search term, which yields titles and pictures with links to the page where the recipe can be found, or generate an idea for something to do on the date while staying home, which includes an idea and a picture with a clickable link to relevant information.  They may click this link any number of times.

At any point in time, the user can return to the opening page using the "Second Thoughts?" button found at the bottom of the screen.
